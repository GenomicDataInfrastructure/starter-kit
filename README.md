# GDI Starter Kit Repository

This repository contains a collection of software applications and components based on open community standards from the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH). By employing this Starter Kit, nodes can acquire the technical ability to access synthetic genomic and phenotypic data across borders.

Please note that these components serve as examples of a feasible implementation, and may be replaced with equivalent software pieces according to specific requirements. Here's an overview of what you'll find in this repository:

- **Beacon - Data discovery**: An implementation of the Beacon protocol, defined by GA4GH, which provides an open standard for the discovery of genomic variants and biomedical data across single or distributed resources.

- **Funnel - Computation**: An implementation of the GA4GH Task Execution Schemas (TES), aiming to standardize APIs used for task execution across multiple platforms.

- **htsget - Data reception**: An implementation of the htsget protocol, enabling secure, efficient, and reliable access to sequencing read and variation data.

- **LifeScience Authentication and Authorisation Infrastructure (LS-AAI) - Authentication**: An authentication service implementing the OpenID Connect protocol.

- **Resource Entitlement Management System (REMS) - Authorization**: A tool to manage access rights to resources such as research datasets, ensuring data security and privacy.

- **Sensitive Data Archive (SDA) - Data storage**: A stack of services for storage and controlled access to sensitive data.

## APIs

## Disclaimer
These components are intended for development and testing purposes only. They should not be used in production environments as they may contain bugs, security vulnerabilities, or other issues that could impact data integrity and confidentiality.
